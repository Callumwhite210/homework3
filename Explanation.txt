Start
after reading the code provided I started by creating my arrays
using the code that Trent gave us during class
completed arrays using Charcode sheet for upper and lower case letters 
created an empty password array to then fill later with confirmed criteria 
created the starting function
insert number between 8 and 128
checks to see if number is valid 
Please input valid number
prompts the user to choose Upper case, lower case, number and special characters
fills in empty array with criteria 
checks the length of password picks at random from arrays selected 
returns password to display
